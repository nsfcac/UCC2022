                                <p>The digital transformation of all areas of life is accelerated in this decade by novel cloud services, e-infrastructures, data platforms and cyber-physical system integration. This broader scope of cloud computing calls for technically sound contributions that combine scale with convenience and reliability. Society and economy depend on cloud applications delivering compute power on demand in every location along data paths as a general service to the public, in analogy to conventional utilities. The engineering of such systems and applications calls for scientifically proven approaches, methods, tools and technologies.</p>
                                <p>Providing a forum to review and discuss possible solutions, UCC is the premier IEEE/ACM conference for areas related to Cloud Computing as a Utility where leading researchers and practitioners in this important and growing field gather on an annual basis.</p>

                                <p>This will be the 15th UCC in a successful conference series of community-driven events. Previous events were held in Shanghai, China (Cloud 2009), Melbourne, Australia (Cloud 2010 & UCC 2011), Chennai, India (UCC 2010), Chicago, USA (UCC 2012), Dresden, Germany (UCC 2013), London, UK (UCC 2014), Limassol, Cyprus (UCC 2015), Shanghai, China (UCC 2016), Austin, Texas, USA (UCC 2017), Zurich, Switzerland (UCC 2018), Auckland, New Zealand (UCC 2019), online during the pandemic (UCC 2020), and Leicester, UK (UCC 2021).</p>

                                <p>UCC 2022 will be hosted at Washington State University.  Portland, Oregonâ€™s largest city, sits on the Columbia and Willamette rivers, in the shadow of snow-capped Mount Hood.</p>

                                <p>UCC 2022 offers a technical programme, workshops, tutorials, and a doctoral symposium. The event will have a co-located 9th International Conference on Big Data Computing Applications and Technologies (BDCAT 2022).</p>

                                <p>Authors are invited to submit original, unpublished research manuscripts in all areas of Cloud and Utility Computing and related computing paradigms such as Fog/Edge, Serverless and Distributed Computing.</p>

                                <p>Authors of accepted papers can opt into reproducible research decoration to publish according to open science conventions; the details are described below.</p>

                                Accepted papers will be invited to undergo an artefact evaluation process that will determine availability of code/data or even reproducibility. An independent committee will handle this process and send the invite along with instructions after the acceptance notification.
                            </p>
                            <p>

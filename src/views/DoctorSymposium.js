                        <p>
                            Welcome to the Doctoral Symposium of the 15th IEEE/ACM International Conference on Utility and Cloud Computing (UCC). The Doctoral Symposium is a forum for PhD students to present their work and receive feedback and guidance. The aim is to provide a space for PhD students to meet and interact with peers, and to receive constructive feedback about their work from experts in the field of cloud computing.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            UCC 2022 will be hosted at Washington State University. Portland, Oregonâ€™s largest city, sits on the Columbia and Willamette rivers, in the shadow of snow-capped Mount Hood.
